** Linear Search Algorithm **

Explanation:
Linear Search works by checking every element of the list one by one until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

Steps:
1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Check each element, one by one.
3. If the element matches the target value, return the index.
4. If the element doesn’t match and we reach the end of the list, return -1 (or some indication that the element isn’t found).

Time Complexity:
Worst-case and average time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
Best case: O(1), if the first element matches the target.

How it works:
1. We define the function linear_search(arr, target) where arr is the list to search, and target is the value we are looking for.
2. The for loop iterates through each element in the array.
3. If the element at index i matches the target, we return that index.
4. If no match is found after going through the list, we return -1.

For example,
For the input list arr = [23, 45, 34, 67, 31] and target = 67, the output would be:
Target 67 is at the index 3.

If the target was not in the list (for example, target = 50), the output would be:
Target 50 not found.

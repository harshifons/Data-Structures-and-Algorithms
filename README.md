This project provides an understanding of the core concepts behind searching algorithms and sorting algorithms.

# 1. Searching Algorithms
These are used to find a particular value in a data structure (usually an array or list).

Linear Search:
Description: Start from the first element and check each element one by one until the target is found.
Time complexity: O(n)
Use Case: When the list is unsorted or small.

Binary Search:
Description: Efficiently finds a target in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Time complexity: O(log n)
Use Case: When you have a sorted list or array.

# 2. Sorting Algorithms
These are used to rearrange elements in a specific order (usually ascending or descending).

Bubble Sort:
Description: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order.
Time complexity: O(n²)
Use Case: Educational purposes or small data sets.

Selection Sort:
Description: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
Time complexity: O(n²)
Use Case: Simple to understand and implement but inefficient for large lists.

Insertion Sort:
Description: Builds the sorted list one item at a time by inserting each element into its proper position.
Time complexity: O(n²)
Use Case: Good for small data sets or lists that are already partially sorted.

Merge Sort:
Description: Divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
Time complexity: O(n log n)
Use Case: Efficient for large data sets and guarantees stable sorting.

Quick Sort:
Description: Divides the list into smaller sub-lists using a pivot, and recursively sorts those sub-lists.
Time complexity: O(n log n) on average, but O(n²) in the worst case.
Use Case: Often the fastest in practice for large datasets.
